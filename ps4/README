Your task is to implement the SplayTree type given in SplayTree.h and
SplayTree.cpp. You shouldn't need to edit any of the other files here, though
you're welcome to look over them if you'd like.
   
To test your implementations manually, run the program ./explore and follow
the prompts.

To get some timing information and run our test harness, run ./run-tests.
Our test harness will do some basic correctness checks on your implementation.
These checks essentially only confirm that elements that should be present
indeed are marked as present and that elements that aren't present get marked
as absent. We do not, however, check that you're producing the right trees,
which is something you'll need to do through your own testing.

run-tests will then run a number of workflows on your implementation and
measure the runtime. You'll get much cleaner information if you crank the
optimization level up to the maximum by editing the Makefile to use -Ofast,
disable debugging, and turn on platform-specific optimizations 
(-march=native).

Good luck, and have fun!
