## Project
An exploration of Dynamic Optimality and Tango Trees. This respository contains unfinished code from our experiments with Tango and Splay trees, which were intended to back up a few unproven theoretical claims. The final paper is available [here](https://nikhilsardana.github.io/tango.pdf).
